    <h2>Design and Development</h2>
    <p>On September 14, 2011, NASA announced its design selection for the new launch system, declaring that it, in combination with the Orion spacecraft, would take the agency's astronauts farther into space than ever before and provide the cornerstone for future US human space exploration   efforts.</p>

      <p>Three versions of the SLS launch vehicle are planned: Block 1, Block 1B, and Block 2. Each will use the same core stage with four main engines, but Block 1B will feature a more powerful second stage called the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS), and Block 2 will combine the EUS with upgraded boosters. Block 1 has a baseline LEO payload capacity of 70 metric tons (77 short tons) and Block 1B has a baseline of 105 metric tons (116 short tons). The proposed Block 2 will have lift capacity of 130 metric tons (140 short tons), which is similar to that of the Saturn V. Some sources state this would make the SLS the most capable heavy lift vehicle built; although the Saturn V lifted approximately 140 metric tons to LEO in the Apollo 17 mission.</p>
      <p>During the development of the SLS a number of configurations were considered, including a Block 0 with three main engines, a Block 1A variant that would have upgraded the vehicle's boosters instead of its second stage, and a Block 2 with five main engines and a different second stage, the Earth Departure Stage, with up to three J-2X engines. In February 2015, it was reported that NASA evaluations showed "over performance" versus the baseline payload for Block 1 and Block 1B configurations.</p>
      <p>On July 31, 2013 the SLS passed the Preliminary Design Review (PDR). The review encompassed all aspects of the SLS' design, not only the rocket and boosters but also ground support and logistical arrangements. On August 7, 2014 the SLS Block 1 passed a milestone known as Key Decision Point C and entered full-scale development, with an estimated launch date of November 2018.</p>
